# Poker Game by Scott Smith
Poker Game is a fully functional Windows Poker game application where players can compete against a CPU opponent.  All poker logic has been implemented to fairly evaluate and score both the player's and the CPU opponent's hands.  A polished user interface and database integration allows the application to store and display a high score chart and other useful Poker statistics! 
Developed from scratch using Python 3!
